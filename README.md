# SLAM from scratch

A from-scratch implementation of a graph-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm, written in C++. The purpose of this project is to learn the mathematics and logic behind graph-based SLAM, and to get practice designing, implementing, and testing a complicated algorithm end to end.

Webots is used as the robot simulation front end, with a TurtleBot driving through an environment while the SLAM system processes sensor data in real time.

## AI Usage

AI tools were used selectively in this project:

- **Testing code**: Test scaffolding and test cases were generated with AI assistance.
- **Visualization code**: The Pygame viewers in `Visualizers/` were built with AI help.
- **Syntax help**: AI was used for C++ syntax questions and general language guidance.
- **Algorithm explanation**: AI was used to explain the theory behind SLAM (pose graph optimization, ICP, etc.) for me to then implement independently.

All core algorithm code in `slam_core/src/` was written by hand.
